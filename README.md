Web Design Challenge:

Web Visualization Dashboard:

This project showcases a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created from other repositories.  It essentially is plotting weather data.
In creating the dashboard, I've created individual pages for each plot and a means by which you can navigate between them.

It also displays a landing page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
